The Never repo provides the \emph{NEighbors serVER}, a web server for
accessing the facilities of the Neighbors
repo\footnote{\ty{github.com/evolbioinf/neighbors}}. The Neighbors
repo contains programs for finding the genome accessions of a set of
\emph{target} taxa and their closest distinct relatives, their
\emph{neighbors}.

Pairs of target/neighbor genome samples can be used for developing
diagnostic markers. This is done by finding regions that are
ubiquitous in the targets and absent from the Neighbors. An example of
a program for doing this is
Fur\footnote{\ty{github.com/evolbioinf/fur}}.

Never is based on the NCBI taxonomy database. This means that apart
from the specifics of developing diagnostic markers, Never can be used
in any context where the NCBI taxonomy serves as an index to the
available whole-genome assemblies.

The NCBI frequently updates its data on taxonomy and genome
accessions. To keep up with this, the database underlying Never is
updated daily. If you'd like to have a stable version of the database,
for example for testing purposes, please construct your own using the
program \ty{makeNeiDb} from the Neighbors repo.
