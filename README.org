** Description
Neighbors Server

** Introduction
[[https://github.com/evolbioinf/neighbors][Neighbors]] is a package for finding the genomes of one or more target
organisms and their closest relatives, their /neighbors/. The
Neighbors server, =never=, provides web access to the facilities of
the Neighbors package.

** Make the Server
Make the program =bin/never=
#+begin_src sh
make
#+end_src

** Run the Server
Given a Neighbors datbase in =~/data/neidb=, the
server can be run locally on port, say, 8080.
#+begin_src sh
./bin/never -o localhost -p 8080 -d ~/data/neidb
#+end_src

See [[http://github.com/evolbioinf/neighbors][Neighbors]] for a
description of how to make a Neighbors database.

** Query for Taxon IDs
If =never= is running as show above, you can download the taxon IDs of
taxa whose name matches /Homo sapiens/ in substring mode. In substring
mode matching is run on the input string wrapped in SQL wild cards,
=%=, and with blanks replaced by wild cards, so =Homo sapiens= becomes =%Homo%sapiens%=
#+begin_src sh
http://localhost:8080/taxi/?t=Homo%20sapiens&s=1
#+end_src

** Make the Documentation
Make `doc/neverDoc.pdf`.
#+begin_src sh
make doc
#+end_src
