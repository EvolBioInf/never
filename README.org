server can be run locally on port, say, 8080.
```
./bin/never -o localhost -p 8080 -d ~/data/neidb
```
See [Neighbors](http://github.com/evolbioinf/neighbors) for a
description of how to make a Neighbors database.

If `never` is running as show above, you can download the taxon IDs of
taxa whose name matches *Homo sapiens* in substring mode.
```
